Inspiration

The inspiration for WELLNEST stemmed from recognizing the unique health challenges faced by two important groups: students and the elderly.

For students, the pressures of academic life, irregular schedules, and the shift to more sedentary lifestyles can lead to neglect of physical and mental health. Many students struggle to balance their studies with self-care, often resulting in stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise. WELLNEST was created to offer students a simple, accessible platform to manage their health proactively, helping them stay on track, with the reminder function, with their well-being even during the busiest times. Moreover, it can be used by schools to give advices for student who face problems with their health.

On the other hand, the elderly often face different challenges, such as managing chronic conditions with the blood pressure measuring feature, maintaining mobility, and staying engaged with their health as they age. WELLNEST is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easier for elderly users to track their health metrics, receive timely advice, and stay motivated to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The platform aims to empower them with the tools they need to take control of their health, offering peace of mind to both the users and their families. 

By focusing on these two groups, WELLNEST seeks to bridge the gap between technology and wellness, providing tailored support to those who need it most. Moreover, for anyone who needs to see emergency contact numbers they can use the app to find out the details of some hospitals

## What it does and why it is usefull

WELLNEST is a comprehensive wellness platform that allows users to track their health metrics, monitor their physical activity, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The platform offers features such as:

User Account Management: Secure sign-up and login functionalities to keep personal data safe.
Notes and Journaling: A personal space for users to jot down their reminders, appointments and even their upcoming assignments.
Heart-rate and Blood-ppressure Monitor: Users can log their heart rate and blood pressure, receive feedback on their vitals, and get advice based on the data entered.
BMI Calculator: A tool to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide tailored health advice based on the results.
Running Tracker: A feature that allows users to log their running distance, duration, and speed, with motivational feedback provided based on their performance.

## How we built it

WELLNEST was built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python, allowing us to create a backend for user management, data storage, and real-time processing. For data persistence, user information and health metrics are stored in text files, ensuring simplicity and ease of use. We implemented secure password management with SHA-256 hashing to protect user credentials. The platform's front-end was crafted with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Challenges I ran into

During the development of WELLNEST, I faced several challenges:

User Data Security: Ensuring that user data, especially sensitive health information, is stored securely and accessed only by the authenticated user was a primary concern.
Relevant: There are many fitness apps out there, so I had to push myself to make a web app that stands out and is not just a rip-off of another app.
Responsive Design: Building a platform that is accessible and user-friendly on multiple devices required thorough testing and adjustments to the UI/UX design.

## What I learned

Through the development of WELLNEST, I gained valuable insights into the importance of secure data handling, user-centered design, and the potential impact of technology on personal health management. I also learned how to create a web app thats functional and private.

## What's next for WELLNEST

Integration with Wearables: I aim to integrate WELLNEST with wearable devices to allow automatic data syncing for a more seamless user experience.
Mental Health Features: Expanding the platform to include mental health monitoring and mindfulness tools.
Social Features: Adding a community aspect where users can share their progress, encourage each other, and participate in wellness challenges.
Advanced Analytics: Providing users with more detailed insights into their health data through trends and predictive analytics.
WELLNEST is just the beginning of our journey to make wellness accessible, engaging, and personalized for everyone.
